# Visual-Basic-for-Applications
This video brings together a selection of programs I created for clients over different stages of my work in Yemen. Each project reflects real-world problem-solving and the diverse approaches Iâ€™ve taken along the way. I used Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) with a relational database as the backend and MS. Access interfaces.
