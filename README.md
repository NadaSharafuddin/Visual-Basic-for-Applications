# IS-Projects-Hub
This video brings together a selection of programs I created for clients over different stages of my work in Yemen. Each project reflects real-world problem-solving and the diverse approaches Iâ€™ve taken along the way. I used Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) with a relational database as the backend and MS. Access interfaces.
You can find a collection of my earlier work and experiments here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmLHy2RT1xY


I also published a complete course on Data Validation for ETL Projects, where I walk through how to design test cases and perform source-to-target validation using SQL.
This course is designed for anyone working with data migration, ETL workflows, or data quality assurance who wants to ensure accuracy, consistency, and reliability across systems.
